        <h2>Context</h2>
        <section id="rcorners1">
            <p>Around the world, waste generation rates are rising. In 2016, the worlds’ cities generated 2.01 billion
                tonnes of solid waste, amounting to a footprint of 0.74 kilograms per person per day. With rapid
                population growth and urbanization, annual waste generation is expected to increase by 70% from 2016
                levels to 3.40 billion tonnes in 2050.</p>

            <p>Compared to those in developed nations, residents in developing countries, especially the urban poor, are
                more severely impacted by unsustainably managed waste. In low-income countries, over 90% of waste is
                often disposed in unregulated dumps or openly burned. These practices create serious health, safety, and
                environmental consequences. Poorly managed waste serves as a breeding ground for disease vectors,
                contributes to global climate change through methane generation, and can even promote urban violence.
            </p>

            <p>Managing waste properly is essential for building sustainable and livable cities, but it remains a
                challenge for many developing countries and cities. Effective waste management is expensive, often
                comprising 20%–50% of municipal budgets. Operating this essential municipal service requires integrated
                systems that are efficient, sustainable, and socially supported.</p>

            <p>The World Bank finances and advises on solid waste management projects using a diverse suite of products
                and services, including traditional loans, results-based financing, development policy financing, and
                technical advisory. World Bank-financed waste management projects address the entire lifecycle of
                waste—from generation to collection and transportation, and finally treatment and disposal.</p>

            Throwing daily waste/garbage in the landfills is the most popularly used method of waste disposal used today. This process of waste disposal focuses attention on burying the waste in the land.Landfills are commonly found in developing countries.There is a process used that eliminates the odors and dangers of waste before it is placed into the ground.While it is true this is the most popular form of waste disposal, it is certainly far from the only procedure and one that may also bring with it an assortment of space.This method is becoming less these days although, thanks to the lack of space available and the strong presence of methane and other landfill gases, both of which can cause numerous contamination problems.Landfills give rise to air and water pollution which severely affects the environment and can prove fatal to the lives of humans and animals. Many areas are reconsidering the use of landfills.</p>

            <p>Incineration or combustion is a type disposal method in which municipal solid wastes are burned
                at high temperatures. The process eventually converts them into residues and gaseous products.
                The biggest advantage of this type of method is that it can reduce the volume of solid waste to 20 to 30 percent of the original volume. Additionally, it also decreases the space they take up while also reducing the stress on landfills.

                    Incinerators are primarily used in thermal treatment where solid waste materials are converted to heat, gas, steam, and ash. Incineration is also widely popular in countries where landfill space is no longer available, such as the US and Japan.This method is becoming less these days although, thanks to the lack of space available and the strong presence of methane and other landfill gases, both of which can cause numerous contamination problems.</p></section></section>

            <p>Resource recovery is the process of taking useful discarded items for a specific next use. These discarded items are then processed to extract or recover materials and resources or convert them to energy in the form of useable heat, electricity or fuel.Recycling is the process of converting waste products into new products to prevent energy usage and consumption of fresh raw materials. Recycling is the third component of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle waste hierarchy.
                    
            The idea behind recycling is to reduce energy usage, reduce the volume of landfills, reduce air
            and water pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and preserve natural resources for future use.

                    <p>Composting is an easy and natural bio-degradation process that takes organic wastes i.e. remains of plants and garden and kitchen waste and turns into nutrient-rich food for your plants. Composting, normally used for organic farming, occurs by allowing organic materials to sit in one place for months until microbes decompose it.Note that composting is often deemed to be one of the best methods of waste disposal as it can turn unsafe organic products into safe compost. The process, however, has its downsides. Some people have found it to be slow, while others have observed that it takes a lot of space.

                    
                    But regardless of these issues, many people are still embracing home composting approaches to manage and reduce waste.</p></section></section>
